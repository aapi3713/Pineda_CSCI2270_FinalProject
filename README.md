# Pineda_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project for CSCI 2270

This project will read in a text file and then pass the text into a hash function that will encrypt the text. The encrypted text will then be printed out. There will also be an option for the user to input their own text for encryption. Along with the encrypted text, a hashtable will be printed out as a key so that the user may decrypt the text if they so wish.
