# Pineda_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project for CSCI 2270

This project will read in a text file and then pass the text into a Linked List. Then the user will select how they want to encrpyt the text. After making a selection, the a key that is generated by a random number function will then be used to encrypt the text.  The encrypted text will then be exported as a text file. There will also be an option for the user to input their own text for encryption.
