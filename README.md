# Pineda_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project for CSCI 2270

Project Summary:
  This project will read in a text file and then pass the text into a Linked List. Then the user will select how they want to encrpyt the text. After making a selection, a key that is generated by a random number generator will then be used to encrypt the text.  The encrypted text will then be exported as a text file. There will also be an option for the user to input their own text for encryption. 

How to run:
  The way this program works is that it either reads in a text file to encrypt, decrypts a text file if the user also knows the key value, and whether it was added or subtracted from the original text, or it allows the user to enter their own text. There are a few text files included in the folder that the user may use if they so choose. The only big thing the user needs to really know is the name of the text file.

Dependencies:
  There are no dependencies for this code.
  
System Requirements:
  Since this was written in CodeBlocks, and CodeBlocks is a VM that can be installed on any OS, this program can be used with any OS.

Bugs:
  -Currently when a text file is encrypted some of the text is changed to outside the usual ASCII values and causes a problem when reading the text file.
  
  -The decrypt choice in the main function must be input twice in order to work.
